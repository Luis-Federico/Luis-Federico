This will build the program Rubik since main2.c. For execute type "./Rubik"
But, if you want to compile main2.c you may do "gcc main2.c -o Rubik $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0) -lm" Remember you may have installed gcc and libgtk-3-dev (for cairo.h).
Only run in Linux. If you have a MAC don't run even if you have X11 and xorg-server don't run.
I was a student of matemathics in 1992-2000.
Currently I'm a student of phisics.
Thank's.
Good look and bye.
